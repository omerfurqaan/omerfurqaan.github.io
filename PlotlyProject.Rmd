## Developing Data Products Week 3 Assignment
- R Markdown Presentation with Plotly Plot
- Volcanoes in the North / East Semihemisphere

## Volcanoes in the North / East Semihemisphere
- Notes
1. The data for the Plotly interactive plot on the following slide is from the following dataset located on Github:
   https://github.com/plotly/datasets/blob/master/volcano_db.csv
2. I was not able to successfully plot all of the volcanoes in the world, so I limited the plot to those in the North / East Semihemisphere (that is, those in both the Northern Hemisphere and the Eastern Hemisphere).
3. When you hover over each location, you will see the volcano's name as well as its coordinates and its status.

# Read in the plotly dataset of volcanoes (over 1,500 of them).

volcanoes_subset1 <- volcanoes[volcanoes$Latitude > 0, ]

# Select only Eastern Hemisphere volcanoes.
volcanoes_subset2 <- volcanoes_subset1[volcanoes_subset1$Longitude > 0, ]

# That gives us a "semihemisphere".
